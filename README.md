# About:
This website is a small passion project on analyzing the outcomes of the DPRK's (North Korea's) modernization programs started around the mid 2010's. I'll focusing more on the mechanized forces of North Korea. 
around 2020-2024~. 
This website examins vehicles of high interest, that demonstrate large technical achievments, or systems that provide major strategic and tatical enhancements to the Korean People's Army (KPA).
I hope to broadly uncover and discuss about these vehicles, as information is relatively lacking to a broad audience. For my enjoyment I did this website in the asthetic of North Korea, and their cheesy at charming asthetics of combining, seemingly period stuck visuals with a new, modern flare. 

Vehicles to be covered as of right now: 
M2020 (Cheonma-2), M2018, Hwasong-18
