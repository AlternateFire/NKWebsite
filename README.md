NK-Website Project, Analyzing North Korea's Mechanized Forces (2020-2024)

Intent:
This website is a small passion project on analyzing the DPRK's (North Korea's) mechanized military modernization programs and their vehicles from
around 2020-2024~. 
Vehicles of high interest, such as notcieable technological breakthroughs, or of a considerable ehnacement to the DPRK's strategic or tatical usefulness will all be briefly mentioned. 
I hope to broadly uncover and discuss about these vehicles, as information is relatively lacking to a broad audience, done in the asthetic of a reforming Korean People's Army, as seen from 2020-onward. 
This was a small project originally started in 2024, continued on to 2025 due to changes in priority.

Vehicles to be covered as of right now: 
M2020 (Cheonma-2), M2018, Hwasong-18
