# NKWebsite - Analyzing North Korea's Mechanized Forces (2020-2024)
NK-Website Project, Analyzing North Korea's Mechanized Forces (2020-2024)

Intent:
This website is a small passion project on analyzing the DPRK's (North Korea's) mechanized military modernization programs and their vehicles from
around 2020-2024~. 
Vehicles of high interest, such as notcieable technological breakthroughs, or of a considerable ehnacement to the DPRK's strategic or tatical usefulness will all be briefly mentioned. 
I hope to uncover and discuss about these vehicles, as information is relatively lacking to a broad audience, done in the asthetic of a reforming Korean People's Army, as seen from 2020-onward. 

Vehicles to be covered: 
M2020 (Cheonma-2), M2018, Unseen MLRS systems, North Korean Iskander, Hwasong-18
