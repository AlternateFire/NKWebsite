# About:
This website is a small passion project on analyzing the outcomes of the DPRK's (North Korea's) modernization programs started around the mid 2010's. I'll focusing more on the mechanized forces of North Korea. 
around 2020-2024~. 
This website examins vehicles of high interest, that demonstrate large technical achievments, or systems that provide major strategic and tatical enhancements to the Korean People's Army (KPA).
I hope to broadly uncover and discuss about these vehicles, as information is relatively lacking to a broad audience. For fun, I did this website in the current propaganda asthetic of North Korea. I personally find the ashtetics quite charming and I thought it would be interesting to design the website off of this style.

Vehicles to be covered as of right now: 
M2020 (Cheonma-2), M2018 (Juche 107), Hwasong-18
